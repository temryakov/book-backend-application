# Go Backend Book Application

This project is a microservices architecture application built using the Go language. Conceptually, the application will consist of an Auth Service for authorization, authentication, and user storage, Gateway Service, as well as a Book Service. This project will evolve along with my learning and growth.

Please feel free to leave your comments if you notice any weak points or questionable design decisions related to architecture or code. Thank you!
